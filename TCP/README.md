# TCP server

This sample code is based on TCP server Echo provided by WIZnet. 

The purpose for using TCP server rather than using client is allowing user doesn't need to change their code frequently. 

The purpose for making this code is letting more people to understand more about WIZnet's solution.

This method added status register checking to handle different kind of communication stage
